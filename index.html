                The ringing plays again, cheers erupting all around you. <br>
                As quick as you can, you grab your stuff and make your way back home. <br>
                The casual conversation repeats again, as it does almost every day. <br>
                “Hellos” and “how was today” are thrown in your way, but you can deal with them. <br>

                Its only once your chatting online that any responsibilities become a noise to faint to hear. <br>
                You enter a new, gorgeous and magnificent place filled with many mysterious ... are those stars? <br>
                No, their people. <br>

                Some are bright, much brighter then the rest. <br>
                Some are dull and ugly, but still shine in their own particular way. <br>
                All different, but yet their constellation means all the same. <br>
                To enjoy the time they share, may it be minutes, hours or even days. <br>

                Their shine? <br>
                Is it their shine? <br>
                It has to be. <br>
                What else could it be. <br>
                You look up once more, verifying your previous hypothesis... but no. <br>

                More constellations have been formed, but its not the same. <br>
